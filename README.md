# University Ranking Prediction Notebook
A notebook that attempts to predict university rankings from previous years
This notebook was created as apart of the final exam in the Big Data Curation course my first 
semester at BI Norwegian Business School. The goal is to implement a model that can be used for
university administrators to be a factor in their decision-making process.

## Disclaimer
University rankings have a negative connotation partly due to they are subjective, quantifying
and aggregating factors that are different to compare. This project is only meant to be a weight in
the decision-making system **if** this particular university wants to focus use it. University rankings
are continously changing from year to year, which makes the ML model limited to its purpose.
